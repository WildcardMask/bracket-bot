# Privacy Policy

Effective Date: August 27, 2025

We respect your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how the Bot handles your data.

## 1. Data Collection

The Bot may access and process the following information as required for its core functions:
- Messages (content, author ID, channel ID) — only at the moment of interaction.
- Basic server and user metadata as provided by Discord (e.g., server ID, user ID, role ID).

No data is stored persistently on external servers unless explicitly stated.

## 2. Data Usage

Data is used only to enable the Bot's intended functionality, such as reading commands and sending replies.

## 3. Data Sharing

We do not share or sell user data to any third party. Data is only processed within Discord’s platform.

## 4. Data Retention

The Bot does **not store** any personal data long-term. Temporary data is held only in memory as needed for processing interactions.

## 5. Children's Privacy

This Bot is not intended for use by children under the age of 13, in compliance with Discord’s own Terms of Service.

## 6. Changes

This Privacy Policy may be updated. Continued use of the Bot after changes are posted implies acceptance of the new policy.
